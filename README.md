Fast and simple HTTP router for Go applications. Supports

* path parameterization,

Uses [sage](https://github.com/nahojer/sage) under the hood to match incoming HTTP requests to handlers.

All of the documentation can be found on the [go.dev](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/nahojer/brisk?tab=doc) website.
